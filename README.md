# AI-Powered Graph Theory Counterexample Discovery

A comprehensive research project combining **Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS)**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, and **Hybrid RL+AMCS** algorithms to discover counterexamples for fundamental graph theory conjectures.

## Project Overview

This repository contains implementations of advanced AI algorithms designed to systematically search for counterexamples to three major graph theory conjectures:

- **Critical Exponents Conjecture**
- **Second Neighborhood Conjecture** 
- **Sidorenko Conjecture**

Each conjecture is approached using multiple algorithmic strategies and different mathematical representations (graphs, graphons, matrices) to maximize the probability of discovering counterexamples.

## Algorithmic Approaches

### 1. Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS)
A sophisticated heuristic search algorithm that:
- Uses nested Monte Carlo methods for local optimization
- Implements adaptive annealing strategies
- Employs graph perturbation techniques
- Provides systematic exploration of the search space

### 2. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Machine learning approach featuring:
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** agents for discrete spaces and **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)** agents for continuous spaces
- Custom graph environments for each conjecture
- Reward functions based on conjecture-specific objectives
- Continuous learning and adaptation

### 3. Hybrid RL+AMCS
Combined approach that:
- Alternates between RL exploration and AMCS refinement
- Uses RL for global exploration and AMCS for local optimization
- Implements knowledge transfer between approaches
- Maximizes strengths of both methodologies

## Mathematical Representations

### Graphs
- **Standard graphs**: Traditional vertex-edge representations
- **Directed graphs**: For orientation-sensitive conjectures
- **Weighted graphs**: Supporting real-valued edge weights

### Graphons
- **Continuous representations**: Limit objects of graph sequences
- **Symmetric matrices**: Values in [0,1] representing edge probabilities
- **Homomorphism integration**: Using advanced calculus techniques

### Matrices
- **Eigenvalue methods**: Spectral approaches to conjecture analysis
- **Optimization on matrix spaces**: Direct search in matrix manifolds
- **Algebraic formulations**: Leveraging linear algebra properties
